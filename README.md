# Online Retail Analysis

**Online Retail Analysis** is a tool designed to inform business decisions through data analysis and visualisation. This tool is built using Python, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Tableau. This tool reads from a raw CSV file, processes the data and shows visualisation insights in a jupter notebook and a Tableau dashboard.

## Dataset Content
* [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekrp1517/online-retail-transactions-dataset)

The dataset contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store. It includes information about customers, products, and transactions, with the following key features:

- InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction
- StockCode: Unique identifier for each product
- Description: Text description of the product
- Quantity: Number of units sold
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
- UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Country: Country of the customer

## Business Requirements
As this is an online retail analysis project, the business requirements may include:
1. **Sales Performance Analysis**: Analyse sales trends over time, identify peak sales periods
2. **Enhancing Customer Retention**: Identify repeat customers, analyse customer purchase behavior such as frequency and value of purchases
3. **Product Performance**: Identify top-selling products, analyse product categories, and assess inventory turnover rates
4. **Geographical Insights**: Analyse sales performance by country or region to determine where to focus marketing efforts
5. **Inventory Management**: Use sales data to inform inventory decisions, such as which products to stock more of and which to discontinue


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 

## Project Plan
1. Data Collection 
    * Gather the dataset from Kaggle
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    * Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types
    * Filter out irrelevant data (e.g., transactions with negative quantities)
    * Create new features (e.g., TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice)
3. Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file
4. Explore Data and visualise
    * Use descriptive statistics to understand the data
    * Create visualisations to identify trends and patterns
5. Dashboard Creation
    * Use Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that includes key metrics and visualisations

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Pandas
